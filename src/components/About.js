      <h1>ECART: Your One-Stop Shop for the Ultimate Gen-Z Look.</h1>
        <p>
        Hey there, style icon!
        We're Ecrat, your go-to platform for all things fashion-forward and fresh. We know Gen Z like the back of our hand, because guess what? We are Gen Z!
        We're tired of boring clothes and limited options. We crave individuality, self-expression, and killer threads that reflect the ever-evolving world around us. That's why we created Ecrat â€“ a curated haven for trendsetters who refuse to be boxed in.
